# Brain_Tumor_Classification
This project uses a VGG19-based deep learning model with transfer learning to classify brain tumors in MRI images. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, and evaluation, achieving over 81% accuracy in tumor detection. Built with TensorFlow and OpenCV, it efficiently identifies tumor regions in medical images.
